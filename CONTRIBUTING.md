## Contributing In General
Our project welcomes external contributions. If you have an itch, please feel
free to scratch it.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/DS4SD/MolGrapher/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/DS4SD/MolGrapher/issues).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

For general questions or support requests, please refer to the [discussion section](https://github.com/DS4SD/MolGrapher/discussions).

**Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!**

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/DS4SD/MolGrapher/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/DS4SD/MolGrapher/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval
